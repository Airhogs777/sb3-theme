**sb3-theme** is a javascript engine that makes it easy to create themes/skins for [Scratch-Blocks](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-blocks) (and Scratch 3.0) as userscripts. It adds classes to every block and input so you can easily style them with CSS. For a list of these classes, see [the wiki](https://github.com/Airhogs777/sb3-theme/wiki/Classes). It also has [a few other functions](https://github.com/Airhogs777/sb3-theme/wiki/Methods-and-Properties) that make styling easier.

Just like Scratch-Blocks, this is a **work-in-progress**. Everything is subject to change. Use at your own risk. :package:
